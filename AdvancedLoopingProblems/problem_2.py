Write code that will print the following:
* * * * * * * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
This is just like the prior problem but also printing 5 and 20 stars. Copy and paste
from the prior problem, adjusting the for loop as needed.
When you have figured it out, or given up, here is the answer:"""

for i in range(10):
	print "*",
print
for i in range(5):
	print "*",
print
for i in range(20):
	print "*",
